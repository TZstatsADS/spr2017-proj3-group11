+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for grayscale images of poodles versus images of fried chickens. We explored different methods for feature extraction and classification. After trying out things, we chose lasso for dimension reduction and the multilayer perceptron classifier, which belongs to the family of neural network. We were able to achieve a classification accuracy for images of poodle dogs and fried chicken of 90%.
