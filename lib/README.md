# Project: Labradoodle or Fried Chicken? 

### Code lib Folder

### Reproduction  

To reproduce the data preprocess for MLP classifier and the SVM classifier, please source feature_selection.R  
(For data preprocess for MLP, you'll need to call the function feature_selection_mlp(); for data preprocess for SVM, you'll need to call the function feature_selection_svm())  

To use processed data directly, please go to the data folder.  

To retrain the MLP and linear SVM classifier, please go to train.R 

To examine the code for MLP classifier alone, please go to MLP-classifier.R for R coder, go to Neural Network.ipynb for python coder.  

To examine the code for linear SVM classifier alone, please go to SVM train.R for R coder, go to linear_svm.ipynb for python coder.  

### To find out the code of other classifiers we tried:

Passive Regressive Classifier:  PassiveRegressiveClassifer.ipynb  

Random Forest: RF.R
Tuning Random Forest Parameter: RF_TUNE.R

Gradient Boosting Tree: gb_tree.R, gbtree_tuning_script.R for R coder, Untuned_gradient_boosting_tree.py and Tuned_GBTree.ipynb for python coder.  

bagging: bagging.ipynb

The Tuning structure we used in general: tuning_structure.ipynb
